Program that can exchange data between computers without central server in a way similar to BitTorrent.
The project was divided into three parts:
Backbone - part responsible for establishing P2P network connections - fully published on Github and as NuGet package - more details here Distributed directory - part described in this post - not published online yet Mobile client - based on Xamarin - more details here Project described in details here (polish version only): praca_inzynierska.</description></item><item><title>Distributed directory for mobile</title><link>https://piotrek-k.pl/projects/distributed_directory_xamarin/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Dec 2020 20:21:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://piotrek-k.pl/projects/distributed_directory_xamarin/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s basically Distributed directory project, with mobile-friendly UI on top of it. Thanks to C# being multiplatform, it was relatively easy to port it to Android devices by using Xamarin. Source code of this project is yet to be published.

Is such networks, all devices are connected to each other. You can use it as a backbone of decentralized systems.
Key features:
Uses UDP Hole Punching technique to connect devices hidden behind NATs Provides end-to-end encryption of sent message&amp;rsquo;s content Uses public-key cryptography to exchange keys Operates on custom UDP based Internet protocol which ensures packet delivery in correct order Detects network memebers automatically.</description></item></channel></rss>
