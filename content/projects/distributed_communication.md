A text messaging system that operates as a distributed network of devices. It is intended to allow communication between users without the need to run a central server. The system is able to continue working regardless of which network member is shut down. Based on idea of [Distibuted Hash Table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table) and [Kademlia protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kademlia).

Carried out in the form of an master's thesis.
